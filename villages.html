            <h1>THE VILLAGES + MIDTOWN</h1> 
            <p>I grew up in Greenwich village and predominately hung out in the villages and Midtown.
                Despite being called the "grossest" part of Manhattan, I think this is the best area for culture 
                and there is always something new to try and something new happening.

            <h2>St.Tropez</h2>
            <p>Saint Tropez has been listed by multiple publications as the best French restaurant 
                in the city, and I agree. Everything here just tastes so fresh and clean, it's amazing how they 
                can turn simple ingredients into such amazing flavors. I love to get seafood here, try something new! 
                They won't disappoint.</p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                I love sea food and how diffeerent cultures cook it - St.Tropez is probably the best place in the city for 
                authentic French seafood. Some of my favorite things on their (very French) menu - Pieuvre Grillée (grilled octopus 
                $16), Daube Provencale (traditional beef stew $22), the Truffle Mac & Cheese ($22), and the Risotto d’Orge aux Champignon 
                (risotto with three types of mushrooms, $22).

            <h2>Raku</h2>
            <p>I first came to Raku with two of my friends on a food crawl in the East Village, funnily enough I didn't get ramen or udon but had rice. 
                This place has been listed as the number 1 udon place in the city over and over again, and it truly is that good. The 
                seating is limited and they are almost always busy, but the wait is definitely worth it! *They are cash only! </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                Some of my favorite things on their menu include the chicken tatsua-age (japanese marinated fried chicken, $11/18), unatama don (eel + egg rice bowl), 
                the kamonan udon (with duck, $21), and the gyunan udon (with washugyu beef, $20). They also have a variety of cold noodles to try for those hot summer days. 
                Definitely take a chance here, you won't be disappointed!

            <h2>Thursday Kitchen</h2>
            <p>Another place I encountered on a food crawl with friends. This place is an amazing restaurant that serves Korean styled tapas,
                the chef really puts a unique twist on the traditional Spansih dishes with Korean flavors. They are also known for having a super
                friendly staff and some potent drinks. The headchef and the owner of the restaurant is Kay Hyun, a South Korean chef that's previously worked some of the best kitchens in the 
                city - ex. Jean-Georges, Nobu's Mai House, and Buddakan. </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                Some of my favorite things on their menu are their Kimichi Paella ($15), Truffle Mac & Cheese (14), 
                Duck Confit Empanadas ($14), and Salmon Tartare Taco ($15). This is one of those places that switch their menus around depending on 
                what fresh ingredients are avaliable throughout the season, so definitely don't be afraid to try some new things.

            <h2>Kazunori</h2>
            <p>Kazunori is the second restauraunt concept by the same team behind Sugarfish - yep, that's right. You know they're good. 
                The restaurant sources their quality fish via the West Coast. This place is where you want to go to try authentic Japanese sushi 
                (clean and delicate) without breaking your bank.  </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                I always reconmmend asking the chefs for what to order at these places, especially because so many times they will make you special
                rolls that are their personal favorites. As for their offical menu though, I love getting their handroll sets, which they offer with 
                3-4 pieces ($17-$33). I love getting salmon, yellowtail, toro, and white tuna!
